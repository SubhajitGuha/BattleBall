# BattleBall
A Unity Game

Controls of the game
======================================================================
First Main menu will appear when you start the game, then from here you can
go to play the main ball game or play the maze game(which you have to play if there is a draw in the ball game).

THE BALL GAME
=============
controls are simple in windows just click over the field to spawn attacker or defender on corresponding sides of the field.

In android just tap on the screen to spawn attacker or defender.

(only works in android and ios compatible devices)
There is a toggle to switch between AR-mode and normal mode. There is also a toggle to disable plane detection (use this to
stop accidentally moving the plane while spawning the players).

while in AR mode you can scale up or down the field using pinch zoom.

THE MAZE GAME
=============
In windows control the attacker using (W, A, S, D) keys.

In Android swipe left, right, up, down (do large swipes) to move the attacker.

*All game parameters are not changed, they as it is mentioned in the document.

You can go to the main-menu from the game by pressing the button in the bottom left corner.
